# Battle stats
A projet by FÃ©lix VIART. <br>
Making strategies and teams in battle cats easier and better.

## Description
**Battle stats** is a project that aimed to make strategies in the mobile game *battle cats* easier to share, and to have a platform that centralises startegies for levels in the game.
This project allowed me to learn the bases of SprintBoot and to reinfoce my knowledge on VueJS.

This project contains 2 part: a SpringBoot back-end and a front-end in VueJS (using Typescript).
